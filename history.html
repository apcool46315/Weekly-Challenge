        appears in their comic books. He is also one of the main protagonists in
        the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man is played by Robert Downey Jr in

        In the movies and the earlier comic books, Tony Stark is a human.
        Outside the suit, he does not have any superpowers, however he is very
        intelligent. He made the suit himself. Iron Man can fly and shoot beams
        from his hands using special technology called "repulsors" in his boots
        and gloves. He is not hurt by most weapons like guns and cannons. There
        are many versions of the Iron Man suit, because Stark keeps making
        improvements. In the later comic books, Stark took an experimental virus
        called "Extremis" which allowed him to control his suit with his mind
        and summon it wherever he was. Stark would eventually develop an armor
        that he could store in his body. This armor was known as the "Bleeding
        Edge Model 37".

      <section>
        Stark inherited a large American company called "Stark Industries" when
        his father died. He was badly injured by a bomb in an attack planned by
        people who did not like him running his company. Shrapnel from the
        explosion was moving towards his heart. This would have killed him, but
        a scientist called Yinsen who was with him made a magnet for his chest
        which would keep the shrapnel away. In the movies, he makes an "arc
        reactor" which is put into his chest to stop the shrapnel. Yinsen and
        Stark secretly build a heavy suit of armor which they plan to use to
        escape. However, during the escape, Yinsen dies so that the kidnappers
        will be distracted from Stark escaping. Stark escapes safely and goes
        back to America. He makes a better suit and uses it to fight evil.

        Tony Stark is charismatic and eccentric, he is also very proud, but also
        very altruist and heroic. He did not have a good childhood, and this
        affects how he acts. Stark is very smart, and a very talented inventor.
        His technology is always very advanced, and Iron Man is his greatest
        piece of work. In both the comics and the movies, he uses the arc
        reactor (or "repulsor technology") as a form of sustainable energy to
        help the world. Stark has very few close friends. Two of them are Pepper
        Potts, his personal assistant who becomes his girlfriend, and James
        Rhodes, an American soldier who operates the War Machine armor.
